/**
 * The press room: LainOS writes the day's post instead of reminding anyone to
 * write one.
 *
 * What it replaces is the point. The daemon used to deliver research digests
 * about other people's chains, a nightly restatement of an unchanged
 * portfolio, and an evening nudge that the channel was quiet — three messages
 * a day, none of which was the thing that had to happen. The thing that has to
 * happen is one post, published, every day, and the operator was two days
 * behind a written plan when this was built.
 *
 * So the queue is a *calendar* (an operator-supplied `content-plan.json`),
 * the material is the repository's own commit log, and the output is the post
 * itself — finished English text the operator copies into the channel, which
 * mirrors to X. Nothing here publishes: this host holds no account session,
 * and a daemon that could post unattended is one that can embarrass the
 * project at 4am. Delivery is the deliverable.
 *
 * Three guards keep it from becoming the noise it replaced:
 *
 *  - **the channel is the truth.** A day the channel published is a day that
 *    needs nothing, and the evening repeat only fires when the draft it
 *    already sent is still unpublished.
 *  - **a backlog drains, it does not flood.** At most `MAX_PER_DAY` drafts a
 *    day, spaced hours apart, and a slot older than `BACKLOG_DAYS` is dropped
 *    rather than published stale.
 *  - **the post is one message.** The header and the text arrive separately,
 *    so "copy" on the post copies the post and nothing else.
 *
 * State lives in `data/press.json`; drafts are pushed through onEvent like
 * sentinel alerts.
